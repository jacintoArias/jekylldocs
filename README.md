# jekylldocs

A variant of the original [staticdocs](ttp://hadley.github.io/staticdocs/) package by Hadley Wickham

This package is meant to generate the documentation content of the original package as a jekyll collection in your /docs folder.

The main purpose is to integrate this newly generated content into an existing jekyll website for your page, allowing you to reuse layouts and generate indexes and references to your documentation using the collections functionalities of the jekyll platform.
