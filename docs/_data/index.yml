  readme: '<h1>jekylldocs</h1>

<p>A variant of the original <a href="http://hadley.github.io/staticdocs/">staticdocs</a> package by Hadley Wickham</p>

<p>This package is meant to generate the documentation content of the original package as a jekyll collection in your /docs folder.</p>

<p>The main purpose is to integrate this newly generated content into an existing jekyll website for your page, allowing you to reuse layouts and generate indexes and references to your documentation using the collections functionalities of the jekyll platform.</p>

<p>For a detailed usage example check the sample page, built with jekyll and the data/collections generated by the package</p>

<p>This page is a replication of original staticdocs format, but being rendered with jekyll</p>

<h3>Calling the new function <code>build_jekyll()</code> would generate:</h3>

<ul>
<li>The package topics as a jekyll collection under the folder <code>/docs/_topics</code>, each topic has its own file and you can render it along your site</li>
<li>The <code>readme</code> and <code>reference</code> information file are generated as jekyll data files under <code>/docs/_data/</code> as .yml files, so you can render the file as you prefer.</li>
</ul>
